udev-block-notify
=================

**Notify about udev block events**

This runs in background and produces notifications whenever udev (or systemd)
receives an event about a block device. Notifications look like this:

![Notification USB](screenshots/usb.png)

Or for optical media:

![Notification cd](screenshots/optical.png)

These are just examples, it shows information about every block device.
